# 📋 Development Plan

Contribution guide for building a production-ready Soroban footprint extraction service.

---

## 🎯 Vision

Automate Soroban footprint extraction and optimization, eliminating complex simulation logic that blocks dApp development.

---

## 🗂️ Work Types

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

**Priority:** High | **Level:** Beginner-Intermediate

Fix crashes, malformed XDR handling, empty footprints, incorrect status codes.

**Contribute:** Find bugs in [ISSUES.md](ISSUES.md) → reproduce → write test → fix → submit PR.

---

### ✨ Features

**Priority:** Medium-High | **Level:** Intermediate-Advanced

**Core:** Health check, batch simulation, caching, rate limiting, webhooks, XDR decoder, fee estimation.

**Advanced:** Footprint optimization, multi-op support, auth extraction, footprint diff, Futurenet.

**Contribute:** Review [ISSUES.md](ISSUES.md) → discuss → implement with tests → update docs → submit PR.

---

### 🔧 Improvements

**Priority:** Medium | **Level:** Intermediate

**Refactor:** Extract constants, split modules, centralize errors, strict TypeScript, dependency injection.

**Tools:** ESLint, Prettier, Husky, nodemon, tsx.

**Performance:** Connection pooling, gzip, optimize parsing, memory profiling, benchmarks.

**Contribute:** Check [ISSUES.md](ISSUES.md) → test before/after → document changes → submit PR.

---

### 🧪 Testing

**Priority:** High | **Level:** Beginner-Intermediate

**Types:** Unit (core functions), Integration (API + RPC), E2E (full workflow), Load (benchmarks).

**Contribute:** Set up Jest → write tests → aim 80%+ coverage → add fixtures → submit PR.

---

### 📖 Documentation

**Priority:** High | **Level:** Beginner-Intermediate

**Types:** API (OpenAPI, examples, errors), Guides (tutorials, deployment, troubleshooting), Code (JSDoc, ADRs), Visual (diagrams).

**Contribute:** Find gaps → write clearly → test instructions → submit PR.

---

### 🔐 Security

**Priority:** Critical | **Level:** Intermediate-Advanced

Helmet, CORS, input validation, XDR injection prevention, size limits, brute-force protection, secret management, vulnerability scans, OWASP compliance.

**Contribute:** Review [ISSUES.md](ISSUES.md) → follow OWASP → test thoroughly → submit PR with impact assessment.

---

### 📦 DevOps

**Priority:** Medium | **Level:** Intermediate-Advanced

**Areas:** Containerization (Docker, compose), CI/CD (GitHub Actions), Monitoring (Prometheus, logging), Infrastructure (K8s, Terraform).

**Contribute:** Check [ISSUES.md](ISSUES.md) → test locally → document → submit PR.

---

### 🌐 Stellar/Soroban

**Priority:** High | **Level:** Advanced

Handle errors, extract auth, fee-bump transactions, restoration workflows, footprint minimization, smart fees, wallet integration, multi-sig.

**Contribute:** Deep Stellar knowledge required → review SDK docs → test with contracts → submit PR.

---

## 🚀 Roadmap

**Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4):** Jest, ESLint, Prettier, unit tests, health check, docs, CI/CD.

**Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8):** Batch simulation, Redis cache, rate limiting, XDR decoder, logging, OpenAPI.

**Phase 3 (Weeks 9-12):** Footprint optimization, fee estimation, profiling, load testing, Prometheus, circuit breaker.

**Phase 4 (Weeks 13-16):** Security audit, Docker/K8s, monitoring, docs polish, beta testing, launch.

---

## 🤝 Getting Started

**Beginners:** Documentation, simple bugs, unit tests, comments.

**Intermediate:** Features, refactoring, integration tests, CI/CD.

**Advanced:** Complex features, performance, security audits, infrastructure.
